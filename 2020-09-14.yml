      operationId: authGet
      description: |-
        The `/auth/get` endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification numbers (such as routing numbers, for US accounts) associated with an Item's checking and savings accounts, along with high-level account data and balances when available.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `auth` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

        Also note that `/auth/get` will not return data for any new accounts opened after the Item was created. To obtain data for new accounts, create a new Item.

        Versioning note: In API version 2017-03-08, the schema of the `numbers` object returned by this endpoint is substantially different. For details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2018-05-22).

        The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. An Item's `status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur multiple times a day for any Transactions-enabled Item. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get`.

        Access to `/transactions/refresh` in Production is specific to certain pricing plans. If you cannot access `/transactions/refresh` in Production, [contact Sales](https://www.plaid.com/contact) for assistance.

        Returns a JSON response containing details on all financial institutions currently supported by Plaid. Because Plaid supports thousands of institutions, results are paginated.

        If there is no overlap between an institution’s enabled products and a client’s enabled products, then the institution will be filtered out from the response. As a result, the number of institutions returned may not match the count specified in the call.

      operationId: itemRemove
      description: |-
        The `/item/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Item. Once removed, the `access_token`, as well as any processor tokens or bank account tokens associated with the Item, is no longer valid and cannot be used to access any data that was associated with the Item.

        Note that in the Development environment, issuing an `/item/remove`  request will not decrement your live credential count. To increase your credential account in Development, contact Support.

        Also note that for certain OAuth-based institutions, an Item removed via `/item/remove` may still show as an active connection in the institution's OAuth permission manager.

        API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier return a `removed` boolean as part of the response.

      operationId: accountsGet
      description: |-
        The `/accounts/get` endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of accounts associated with any linked Item. Plaid will only return active bank accounts — that is, accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.
        For items that went through the updated account selection pane, this endpoint only returns accounts that were permissioned by the user when they initially created the Item. If a user creates a new account after the initial link, you can capture this event through the [`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.

        This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, balances returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/accounts/balance/get` instead. Note that some information is nullable.

      description: Use the `/sandbox/processor_token/create` endpoint to create a valid `processor_token` for an arbitrary institution ID and test credentials. The created `processor_token` corresponds to a new Sandbox Item. You can then use this `processor_token` with the `/processor/` API endpoints in Sandbox. You can also use `/sandbox/processor_token/create` with the [`user_custom` test username](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom) to generate a test account with custom data.

      externalDocs:

      operationId: sandboxItemFireWebhook
      description: |-
        The `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook` endpoint is used to test that code correctly handles webhooks. This endpoint can trigger the following webhooks:
        `DEFAULT_UPDATE`: Transactions update webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.

        `NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item created with Account Select v2.

        `AUTH_DATA_UPDATE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item created with Auth as an enabled product.

        Note that this endpoint is provided for developer ease-of-use and is not required for testing webhooks; webhooks will also fire in Sandbox under the same conditions that they would in Production or Development'

      description: The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints may return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link.

        The `/identity/get` endpoint allows you to retrieve various account holder information on file with the financial institution, including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. Only name data is guaranteed to be returned; other fields will be empty arrays if not provided by the institution.

        This request may take some time to complete if identity was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the data.

        Note: In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, the `owners` object is not returned, and instead identity information is returned in the top level `identity` object. For more details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2019-05-29).

        The `/processor/auth/get` endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification number (such as the routing number, for US accounts), for a checking or savings account that''s associated with a given `processor_token`. The endpoint also returns high-level account data and balances when available.

        Versioning note: API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier use a different schema for the `numbers` object returned by this endpoint. For details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2020-09-14).

          The `/processor/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for the account associated with a given `processor_token`.

          The current balance is the total amount of funds in the account. The available balance is the current balance less any outstanding holds or debits that have not yet posted to the account.

          Note that not all institutions calculate the available balance. In the event that available balance is unavailable from the institution, Plaid will return an available balance value of `null`.

        By default, the `access_token` associated with an Item does not expire and should be stored in a persistent, secure manner.

        You can use the `/item/access_token/invalidate` endpoint to rotate the `access_token` associated with an Item. The endpoint returns a new `access_token` and immediately invalidates the previous `access_token`.

        The `/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about an Item with loan or credit accounts. Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filters` parameter when [creating a Link token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/tokens/#linktokencreate).

        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.

        After creating a payment recipient, you can use the `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.  Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR or GBP.  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer and GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer will typically arrive in one business day.

        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

        In the Development environment, payments must be below 5 GBP / EUR. For details on any payment limits in Production, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been deprecated. New Plaid customers will be unable to use this endpoint, and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the newer, `link_token`-based flow. The recommended flow is to provide the `payment_id` to `/link/token/create`, which returns a `link_token` used to initialize Link.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` is used to create a `payment_token`, which can then be used in Link initialization to enter a payment initiation flow. You can only use a `payment_token` once. If this attempt fails, the end user aborts the flow, or the token expires, you will need to create a new payment token. Creating a new payment token does not require end user input.

        Consents can be limited in time and scope, and have constraints that describe limitations for payments.

        `/sandbox/item/reset_login/` forces an Item into an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` state in order to simulate an Item whose login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) flow in the Sandbox environment.  After calling `/sandbox/item/reset_login`, You can then use Plaid Link update mode to restore the Item to a good state. An `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` webhook will also be fired after a call to this endpoint, if one is associated with the Item.


        In the Sandbox, Items will transition to an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error state automatically after 30 days, even if this endpoint is not called.

        Exchange a Link `public_token` for an API `access_token`. Link hands off the `public_token` client-side via the `onSuccess` callback once a user has successfully created an Item. The `public_token` is ephemeral and expires after 30 minutes. An `access_token` does not expire, but can be revoked by calling `/item/remove`.

        The response also includes an `item_id` that should be stored with the `access_token`. The `item_id` is used to identify an Item in a webhook. The `item_id` can also be retrieved by making an `/item/get` request.

        Note: As of July 2020, the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is deprecated. Instead, use `/link/token/create` with an `access_token` to create a Link token for use with [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode).

        If you need your user to take action to restore or resolve an error associated with an Item, generate a public token with the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint and then initialize Link with that `public_token`.

        A `public_token` is one-time use and expires after 30 minutes. You use a `public_token` to initialize Link in [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) for a particular Item. You can generate a `public_token` for an Item even if you did not use Link to create the Item originally.

        The `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is **not** used to create your initial `public_token`. If you have not already received an `access_token` for a specific Item, use Link to obtain your `public_token` instead. See the [Quickstart](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart) for more information.

        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoints.

        The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).

        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.

        An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user's assets. In order to "refresh" an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.

        The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to `/asset_report/filter`. By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original `/asset_report/create` request, but the original `days_requested` value and the values of any parameters in the `options` object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to `/asset_report/refresh`. Submit an empty string ("") for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

      description: |-
        By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

        To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.

        Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

        Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

        The `/asset_report/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling `/asset_report/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report.

        To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call the `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

        Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.

        To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

      description: The `/asset_report/audit_copy/remove` endpoint allows you to remove an Audit Copy. Removing an Audit Copy invalidates the `audit_copy_token` associated with it, meaning both you and any third parties holding the token will no longer be able to use it to access Report data. Items associated with the Asset Report, the Asset Report itself and other Audit Copies of it are not affected and will remain accessible after removing the given Audit Copy.

        Plaid can share an Asset Report directly with a participating third party on your behalf. The shared Asset Report is the exact same Asset Report originally created in `/asset_report/create`.

        To grant access to an Asset Report to a third party, use the `/asset_report/relay/create` endpoint to create an `asset_relay_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `secondary_client_id`, for example `ce5bd328dcd34123456`. You'll need to create a separate `asset_relay_token` for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

      description: |-
        The `/investments/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to retrieve user-authorized transaction data for investment accounts.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.

        Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.

        `/item/import` creates an Item via your Plaid Exchange Integration and returns an `access_token`. As part of an `/item/import` request, you will include a User ID (`user_auth.user_id`) and Authentication Token (`user_auth.auth_token`) that enable data aggregation through your Plaid Exchange API endpoints. These authentication principals are to be chosen by you.

        Upon creating an Item via `/item/import`, Plaid will automatically begin an extraction of that Item through the Plaid Exchange infrastructure you have already integrated. This will automatically generate the Plaid native account ID for the account the user will switch their direct deposit to (`target_account_id`).

        The `/link/token/create` endpoint creates a `link_token`, which is required as a parameter when initializing Link. Once Link has been initialized, it returns a `public_token`, which can then be exchanged for an `access_token` via `/item/public_token/exchange` as part of the main Link flow.

        A `link_token` generated by `/link/token/create` is also used to initialize other Link flows, such as the update mode flow for tokens with expired credentials, or the Payment Initiation (Europe) flow.

        Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to determine transfer failure risk.

        In Plaid's sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:

          - To approve a transfer with null rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.

          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).

          - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `LOGIN_REQUIRED`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).

          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

          - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.

        Use the `/bank_transfer/balance/get` endpoint to see the available balance in your bank transfer account. Debit transfers increase this balance once their status is posted. Credit transfers decrease this balance when they are created.

        The transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance minus your minimum balance.

        Note that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration. It cannot be used on your own account when using Bank Transfers in the BTS Platform configuration.

        `/employers/search` allows you the ability to search Plaid’s database of known employers, for use with Deposit Switch. You can use this endpoint to look up a user's employer in order to confirm that they are supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of the Deposit Switch flow.

        The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Deposit Switch and Income products progress through their respective beta periods, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or store data from this endpoint for more than a day.

You can then provide the `income_verification_id` to `/link/token/create` under the `income_verification` parameter in order to create a Link instance that will prompt the user to go through the income verification flow. Plaid will fire an `INCOME` webhook once the user completes the Payroll Income flow, or when the uploaded documents in the Document Income flow have finished processing. '

        `/income/verification/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification and returns a `precheck_id` that can be provided to `/link/token/create`. If the user is eligible for digital verification, providing the `precheck_id` in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the `precheck_id` can still be provided to `/link/token/create` and the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

        While all request fields are optional, providing either `employer` or `transactions_access_tokens` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

        This endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` instead.

        `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification. If the user is eligible for digital verification, that information will be associated with the user token, and in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

        While all request fields are optional, providing `employer` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

      description: |-
        Use `/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and risk tier) and additional risk signals.

        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If `/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned.

            - Spanish (`'es'`)
            - Dutch (`'nl'`)

            Specify an array of Plaid-supported country codes using the ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code standard. Institutions from all listed countries will be shown.  Supported country codes are: `US`, `CA`, `DE`, `ES`, `FR`, `GB`, `IE`, `IT`, `NL`. For a complete mapping of supported products by country, see https://plaid.com/global/.

            If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox and Development, in Production only US and Canada are enabled by default. To gain access to European institutions in the Production environment, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard. If you initialize with a European country code, your users will see the European consent panel during the Link flow.

            If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in `country_codes`. If both `country_codes` and a Link customization are used, the value in `country_codes` may override the value in the customization.

            If using the Auth features Instant Match, Same-day Micro-deposits, or Automated Micro-deposits, `country_codes` must be set to `['US']`.

            List of Plaid product(s) you wish to use. If launching Link in update mode, should be omitted; required otherwise.

            `balance` is *not* a valid value, the Balance product does not require explicit initialization and will automatically be initialized when any other product is initialized.

            Only institutions that support *all* requested products will be shown in Link; to maximize the number of institutions listed, it is recommended to initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. Additional products can be added after Link initialization by calling the relevant endpoints. For details and exceptions, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/best-practices/#choosing-when-to-initialize-products).

            Note that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.

            In Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`.

    LinkTokenAccountFilters:

You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).

        For institutions using OAuth, the filter will not affect the list of accounts shown by the bank in the OAuth window.

            The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

            For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

            For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

            Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

            Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

            For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

            For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

            Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            The ACH account number for the account.

            Note that when using OAuth with Chase Bank (`ins_56`), Chase will issue "tokenized" routing and account numbers, which are not the user's actual account and routing numbers. These tokenized numbers should work identically to normal account and routing numbers. The digits returned in the `mask` field will continue to reflect the actual account number, rather than the tokenized account number; for this reason, when displaying account numbers to the user to help them identify their account in your UI, always use the `mask` rather than truncating the `account` number. If a user revokes their permissions to your app, the tokenized numbers will continue to work for ACH deposits, but not withdrawals.

A login attempt is conducted during the initial Item add in Link. If there is not enough traffic to accurately calculate an institution's status, Plaid will return null rather than potentially inaccurate data.

        Institution status is accessible in the Dashboard and via the API using the `/institutions/get_by_id` endpoint with the `include_status` option set to true. Note that institution status is not available in the Sandbox environment.

        Describes a sweep of funds to / from the sweep account.

        A sweep is associated with many sweep events (events of type `swept` or `reverse_swept`) which can be retrieved by invoking the `/transfer/event/list` endpoint with the corresponding `sweep_id`.

        `swept` events occur when the transfer amount is credited or debited from your sweep account, depending on the `type` of the transfer. `reverse_swept` events occur when a transfer is reversed and Plaid undoes the credit or debit.

        The total sum of the `swept` and `reverse_swept` events is equal to the `amount` of the sweep Plaid creates and matches the amount of the entry on your sweep account ledger.

        A random key provided by the client, per unique wallet transaction. Maximum of 128 characters.

        The API supports idempotency for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. If a request to execute a wallet transaction fails due to a network connection error, then after a minimum delay of one minute, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single wallet transaction is created. If the request was successfully processed, it will prevent any transaction that uses the same idempotency key, and was received within 24 hours of the first request, from being processed.
