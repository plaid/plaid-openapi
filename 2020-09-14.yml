        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint initiates the process of creating an Asset Report, which can then be retrieved by passing the `asset_report_token` return value to the `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get` endpoints.

        The Asset Report takes some time to be created and is not available immediately after calling `/asset_report/create`. The exact amount of time to create the report will vary depending on how many days of history are requested and will typically range from a few seconds to about one minute. When the Asset Report is ready to be retrieved using `/asset_report/get` or `/asset_report/pdf/get`, Plaid will fire a `PRODUCT_READY` webhook. For full details of the webhook schema, see [Asset Report webhooks](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#webhooks).

        The `/asset_report/create` endpoint creates an Asset Report at a moment in time. Asset Reports are immutable. To get an updated Asset Report, use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint.

        The `/asset_report/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in JSON format. Before calling `/asset_report/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/asset_report/create` (or filter an Asset Report using `/asset_report/filter`) and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        By default, an Asset Report includes transaction descriptions as returned by the bank, as opposed to parsed and categorized by Plaid. You can also receive cleaned and categorized transactions, as well as additional insights like merchant name or location information. We call this an Asset Report with Insights. An Asset Report with Insights provides transaction category, location, and merchant information in addition to the transaction strings provided in a standard Asset Report. To retrieve an Asset Report with Insights, call `/asset_report/get` endpoint with `include_insights` set to `true`.

        For latency-sensitive applications, you can optionally call `/asset_report/create` with `options.add_ons` set to `["fast_assets"]`. This will cause Plaid to create two versions of the Asset Report: one with only current and available balance and identity information, and then later on the complete Asset Report. You will receive separate webhooks for each version of the Asset Report.

        An Asset Report is an immutable snapshot of a user's assets. In order to "refresh" an Asset Report you created previously, you can use the `/asset_report/refresh` endpoint to create a new Asset Report based on the old one, but with the most recent data available.

        The new Asset Report will contain the same Items as the original Report, as well as the same filters applied by any call to `/asset_report/filter`. By default, the new Asset Report will also use the same parameters you submitted with your original `/asset_report/create` request, but the original `days_requested` value and the values of any parameters in the `options` object can be overridden with new values. To change these arguments, simply supply new values for them in your request to `/asset_report/refresh`. Submit an empty string ("") for any previously-populated fields you would like set as empty.

        By default, an Asset Report will contain all of the accounts on a given Item. In some cases, you may not want the Asset Report to contain all accounts. For example, you might have the end user choose which accounts are relevant in Link using the Account Select view, which you can enable in the dashboard. Or, you might always exclude certain account types or subtypes, which you can identify by using the `/accounts/get` endpoint. To narrow an Asset Report to only a subset of accounts, use the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint.

        To exclude certain Accounts from an Asset Report, first use the `/asset_report/create` endpoint to create the report, then send the `asset_report_token` along with a list of `account_ids` to exclude to the `/asset_report/filter` endpoint, to create a new Asset Report which contains only a subset of the original Asset Report's data.

        Because Asset Reports are immutable, calling `/asset_report/filter` does not alter the original Asset Report in any way; rather, `/asset_report/filter` creates a new Asset Report with a new token and id. Asset Reports created via `/asset_report/filter` do not contain new Asset data, and are not billed.

        Plaid will fire a [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook once generation of the filtered Asset Report has completed.

        The `/item/remove` endpoint allows you to invalidate an `access_token`, meaning you will not be able to create new Asset Reports with it. Removing an Item does not affect any Asset Reports or Audit Copies you have already created, which will remain accessible until you remove them specifically.

        The `/asset_report/remove` endpoint allows you to remove access to an Asset Report. Removing an Asset Report invalidates its `asset_report_token`, meaning you will no longer be able to use it to access Report data or create new Audit Copies.

        Plaid can provide an Audit Copy of any Asset Report directly to a participating third party on your behalf. For example, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf if you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program. An Audit Copy contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report.

        To grant access to an Audit Copy, use the `/asset_report/audit_copy/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the third party who needs access. Each third party has its own `auditor_id`, for example `fannie_mae`. You’ll need to create a separate Audit Copy for each third party to whom you want to grant access to the Report.

        `/cra/check_report/create` creates a Consumer Report powered by Plaid Check. You can call this endpoint to create a new report if `consumer_report_permissible_purpose` was omitted during Link token creation. If you did provide a `consumer_report_permissible_purpose` during Link token creation, then Plaid Check will automatically begin creating a Consumer Report once the user completes the Link process, and it is not necessary to call `/cra/check_report/create` before retrieving the report.

         `/cra/check_report/create` can also be used to refresh data in an existing report. A Consumer Report will last for 24 hours before expiring; you should call any `/get` endpoints on the report before it expires. If a report expires, you can call `/cra/check_report/create` again to re-generate it. Note that refreshing or regenerating a report is a billable event.

You should call this endpoint after you've received the `CHECK_REPORT_READY` webhook, either after the Link session for the user or after calling `/cra/check_report/create`. If the most recent consumer report for the user doesn’t have sufficient data to generate the base report, or the consumer report has expired, you will receive an error indicating that you should create a new consumer report by calling `/cra/check_report/create`.

        If you did not initialize Link with the `credit_partner_insights` product or have generated a report using `/cra/check_report/create`, we will call our partners to generate the insights when you call this endpoint. In this case, you may optionally provide parameters under `options` to configure which insights you want to receive.

        This endpoint allows you to retrieve the Network Insights product for your user. You should call this endpoint after you've received the `CHECK_REPORT_READY` webhook, either after the Link session for the user or after calling `/cra/check_report/create`. If the most recent consumer report for the user doesn’t have sufficient data to generate the report, or the consumer report has expired, you will receive an error indicating that you should create a new consumer report by calling `/cra/check_report/create`.

        If you did not initialize Link with the `cra_network_attributes` product or have generated a report using `/cra/check_report/create`, we will generate the attributes when you call this endpoint.

        This endpoint only removes ongoing data access permissions, therefore the User will need to reach out to the Application itself in order to disable and delete their account and delete any data that the Application already received (if the Application does not do so by default).

        This endpoint should be called in real time as the User is unlinking an Application, and should not be batched in order to ensure that the change is reflected as soon as possible.

        Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use `/transactions/sync` rather than `/transactions/get`. `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.

        The `/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the [Investments endpoint](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/) instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

        Data returned by `/transactions/get` will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the [`INITIAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#initial_update) and [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when `/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

        `/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call `/transactions/refresh`.

        If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/transactions/sync` and `/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`.

        Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.

        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

        `/transactions/refresh` is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

      description: "The `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.\n\nThis endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.\n\nThis endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/transactions/get` or `/transactions/sync`). \n\nWhen using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the [`days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.\n\nAfter the initial call, you can call `/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available."

        The `/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with an Item and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.

        `/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates. To learn more about migrating from `/transactions/get`, see the [Transactions Sync migration guide](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/sync-migration/).

        This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.

        Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.

        In the first call to `/transactions/sync` for an Item, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that Item up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that Item. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.

        When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/transactions/sync` fails due to the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.

        Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the [Item Debugger](https://plaid.com/docs/account/activity/#troubleshooting-with-item-debugger) or call `/item/get`; the `item.status.transactions.last_successful_update` field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        For newly created Items, data may not be immediately available to `/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.

        To be alerted when new data is available, listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) webhook.

        Returns a JSON response containing details on all financial institutions currently supported by Plaid. Because Plaid supports thousands of institutions, results are paginated.

        If there is no overlap between an institution’s enabled products and a client’s enabled products, then the institution will be filtered out from the response. As a result, the number of institutions returned may not match the count specified in the call.

Once removed, the `access_token`, as well as any processor tokens or bank account tokens associated with the Item, is no longer valid and cannot be used to access any data that was associated with the Item. \n\nCalling `/item/remove` is a recommended best practice when offboarding users or if a user chooses to disconnect an account linked via Plaid. For subscription products, such as Transactions, Liabilities, and Investments, calling `/item/remove` is required to end subscription billing for the Item.\n\nIn Limited Production, calling `/item/remove` does not impact the number of remaining Limited Production Items you have available.\n\nRemoving an Item does not affect any Asset Reports or Audit Copies you have already created, which will remain accessible until you remove access to them specifically using the `/asset_report/remove` endpoint.\n\nAlso note that for certain OAuth-based institutions, an Item removed via `/item/remove` may still show as an active connection in the institution's OAuth permission manager.\n\nAPI versions 2019-05-29 and earlier return a `removed` boolean as part of the response."

      summary: Retrieve accounts
      externalDocs:

      operationId: accountsGet
      description: |-
        The `/accounts/get` endpoint can be used to retrieve a list of accounts associated with any linked Item. Plaid will only return active bank accounts — that is, accounts that are not closed and are capable of carrying a balance.
        To return new accounts that were created after the user linked their Item, you can listen for the [`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/items/#new_accounts_available) webhook and then use Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode/) to request that the user share this new account with you.

        `/accounts/get` is free to use and retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. The balance returned will reflect the balance at the time of the last successful Item update. If the Item is enabled for a regularly updating product, such as Transactions, Investments, or Liabilities, the balance will typically update about once a day, as long as the Item is healthy. If the Item is enabled only for products that do not frequently update, such as Auth or Identity, balance data may be much older.

        For realtime balance information, use the paid endpoint `/accounts/balance/get` instead.

        Send a request to the `/categories/get` endpoint to get detailed information on categories returned by Plaid. This endpoint does not require authentication.

        All implementations are recommended to use the newer `personal_finance_category` taxonomy instead of the older `category` taxonomy supported by this endpoint. The [`personal_finance_category taxonomy` CSV file](https://plaid.com/documents/transactions-personal-finance-category-taxonomy.csv) is available for download and is not accessible via API.

      operationId: sandboxItemFireWebhook
      description: "The `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook` endpoint is used to test that code correctly handles webhooks. This endpoint can trigger the following webhooks:\n\n`DEFAULT_UPDATE`: Webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item simulating a default update event for the respective product as specified with the `webhook_type` in the request body. Valid Sandbox `DEFAULT_UPDATE` webhook types include: `AUTH`, `IDENTITY`, `TRANSACTIONS`, `INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS`, `LIABILITIES`, `HOLDINGS`. If the Item does not support the product, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\n`NEW_ACCOUNTS_AVAILABLE`: Fired to indicate that a new account is available on the Item and you can launch update mode to request access to it.\n\n`SMS_MICRODEPOSITS_VERIFICATION`: Fired when a given same day micro-deposit item is verified via SMS verification.\n\n`LOGIN_REPAIRED`: Fired when an Item recovers from the `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` without the user going through update mode in your app.\n\n`PENDING_DISCONNECT`: Fired when an Item will stop working in the near future (e.g. due to a planned bank migration) and must be sent through update mode to continue working. \n\n`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`: Recurring Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item. If the Item does not support Recurring Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\n`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`: Transactions webhook to be fired for a given Sandbox Item.  If the Item does not support Transactions, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\n`PRODUCT_READY`: Assets webhook to be fired when a given asset report has been successfully generated. If the Item does not support Assets, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\n`ERROR`: Assets webhook to be fired when asset report generation has failed. If the Item does not support Assets, a `SANDBOX_PRODUCT_NOT_ENABLED` error will result.\n\nNote that this endpoint is provided for developer ease-of-use and is not required for testing webhooks; webhooks will also fire in Sandbox under the same conditions that they would in Production (except for webhooks of type `TRANSFER`)."

      description: The `/accounts/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for each of an Item's accounts. While other endpoints, such as `/accounts/get`, return a balance object, only `/accounts/balance/get` forces the available and current balance fields to be refreshed rather than cached. This endpoint can be used for existing Items that were added via any of Plaid’s other products. This endpoint can be used as long as Link has been initialized with any other product, `balance` itself is not a product that can be used to initialize Link. As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

        The `/identity/get` endpoint allows you to retrieve various account holder information on file with the financial institution, including names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses. Only name data is guaranteed to be returned; other fields will be empty arrays if not provided by the institution.

        Note: In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, the `owners` object is not returned, and instead identity information is returned in the top level `identity` object. For more details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2019-05-29).

        The `/identity/match` endpoint generates a match score, which indicates how well the provided identity data matches the identity information on file with the account holder's financial institution.

        Fields within the `balances` object will always be null when retrieved by `/identity/match`. Instead, use the free `/accounts/get` endpoint to request balance cached data, or `/accounts/balance/get` for real-time data.

        `/identity/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Identity product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the most up to date Identity information from the Financial Institution. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur for any Identity-enabled Item. If changes to Identity are discovered after calling `/identity/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/identity/#default_update).

        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

        `/identity/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Identity and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

      summary: Create a new Identity Verification
      description: |
        Create a new Identity Verification for the user specified by the `client_user_id` field. The requirements and behavior of the verification are determined by the `template_id` provided.
        If you don't know whether the associated user already has an active Identity Verification, you can specify `"is_idempotent": true` in the request body. With idempotency enabled, a new Identity Verification will only be created if one does not already exist for the associated `client_user_id` and `template_id`. If an Identity Verification is found, it will be returned unmodified with an `200 OK` HTTP status code.

        You can also use this endpoint to supply information you already have collected about the user; if any of these fields are specified, the screens prompting the user to enter them will be skipped during the Link flow.

        Create and scan a Beacon User against your Beacon Program, according to your program's settings.

        When you submit a new user to `/beacon/user/create`, several checks are performed immediately:

          - The user's PII (provided within the `user` object) is searched against all other users within the Beacon Program you specified. If a match is found that violates your program's "Duplicate Information Filtering" settings, the user will be returned with a status of `pending_review`.

          - The user's PII is also searched against all fraud reports created by your organization across all of your Beacon Programs. If the user's data matches a fraud report that your team created, the user will be returned with a status of `rejected`.

          - Finally, the user's PII is searched against all fraud report shared with the Beacon Network by other companies. If a matching fraud report is found, the user will be returned with a `pending_review` status if your program has enabled automatic flagging based on network fraud.

        Update the status of a Beacon User.

        When updating a Beacon User's status via this endpoint, Plaid validates that the status change is consistent with the related state for this Beacon User. Specifically, we will check:

        1. Whether there are any associated Beacon Reports connected to the Beacon User, and
        2. Whether there are any confirmed Beacon Report Syndications connected to the Beacon User.

        When updating a Beacon User's status to "rejected", we enforce that either a Beacon Report has been created for the Beacon User or a Beacon Report Syndication has been confirmed.
        When updating a Beacon User's status to "cleared", we enforce that there are no active Beacon Reports or confirmed Beacon Report Syndications associated with the user. If you previously created a Beacon Report for this user, you must delete it before updating the Beacon User's status to "cleared".
        There are no restrictions on updating a Beacon User's status to "pending_review".

        If these conditions are not met, the request will be rejected with an error explaining the issue.

A Beacon User can only have one active report at a time, but a new report can be created if a previous report has been deleted. The results from this endpoint are paginated; the `next_cursor` field will be populated if there is another page of results that can be retrieved. To fetch the next page, pass the `next_cursor` value as the `cursor` parameter in the next request.

      description: Use the `/beacon/report_syndication/list` endpoint to view all Beacon Reports that have been syndicated to a specific Beacon User. This endpoint returns Beacon Report Syndications which are references to Beacon Reports created either by you, or another Beacon customer, that matched the specified Beacon User. A Beacon User can have multiple active Beacon Report Syndications at once. The results from this endpoint are paginated; the `next_cursor` field will be populated if there is another page of results that can be retrieved. To fetch the next page, pass the `next_cursor` value as the `cursor` parameter in the next request.

        Update the identity data for a Beacon User in your Beacon Program or add new accounts to the Beacon User.

        Similar to `/beacon/user/create`, several checks are performed immediately when you submit an identity data change to `/beacon/user/update`:

          - The user's updated PII is searched against all other users within the Beacon Program you specified. If a match is found that violates your program's "Duplicate Information Filtering" settings, the user will be returned with a status of `pending_review`.

          - The user's updated PII is also searched against all fraud reports created by your organization across all of your Beacon Programs. If the user's data matches a fraud report that your team created, the user will be returned with a status of `rejected`.

          - Finally, the user's PII is searched against all fraud report shared with the Beacon Network by other companies. If a matching fraud report is found, the user will be returned with a `pending_review` status if your program has enabled automatic flagging based on network fraud.

        Plaid maintains a version history for each Beacon User, so the Beacon User's identity data before and after the update is retained as separate versions.

        Returns a Beacon Duplicate for a given Beacon Duplicate id.

        A Beacon Duplicate represents a pair of similar Beacon Users within your organization.

        Two Beacon User revisions are returned for each Duplicate record in either the `beacon_user1` or `beacon_user2` response fields.

        The `analysis` field in the response indicates which fields matched between `beacon_user1` and `beacon_user2`.

        The `/processor/auth/get` endpoint returns the bank account and bank identification number (such as the routing number, for US accounts), for a checking or savings account that''s associated with a given `processor_token`. The endpoint also returns high-level account data and balances when available.

        Versioning note: API versions 2019-05-29 and earlier use a different schema for the `numbers` object returned by this endpoint. For details, see [Plaid API versioning](https://plaid.com/docs/api/versioning/#version-2020-09-14).

        This endpoint returns the account associated with a given processor token.

        This endpoint retrieves cached information, rather than extracting fresh information from the institution. As a result, the account balance returned may not be up-to-date; for realtime balance information, use `/processor/balance/get` instead. Note that some information is nullable.

        The `/processor/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.  Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in `/processor/transactions/get`.  For more details, see [Pending and posted transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/transactions/transactions-data/#pending-and-posted-transactions).

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. Manipulate the `count` and `offset` parameters in conjunction with the `total_transactions` response body field to fetch all available transactions.

        Data returned by `/processor/transactions/get` will be the data available for the processor token as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/get`. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with `transactions`, or upon the first call to `/processor/transactions/get`, if it wasn't. If no transaction history is ready when `/processor/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

        This endpoint replaces `/processor/transactions/get` and its associated webhooks for most common use-cases.

        The `/processor/transactions/sync` endpoint allows developers to subscribe to all transactions associated with a processor token and get updates synchronously in a stream-like manner, using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen. `/processor/transactions/sync` provides the same functionality as `/processor/transactions/get` and can be used instead of `/processor/transactions/get` to simplify the process of tracking transactions updates.

        This endpoint provides user-authorized transaction data for `credit`, `depository`, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype `student`; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from `investments` accounts, use `/investments/transactions/get` instead.

        Returned transactions data is grouped into three types of update, indicating whether the transaction was added, removed, or modified since the last call to the API.

        In the first call to `/processor/transactions/sync` for a processor token, the endpoint will return all historical transactions data associated with that processor token up until the time of the API call (as "adds"), which then generates a `next_cursor` for that processor token. In subsequent calls, send the `next_cursor` to receive only the changes that have occurred since the previous call.

        Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with a processor token, results are paginated. The `has_more` field specifies if additional calls are necessary to fetch all available transaction updates. Call `/processor/transactions/sync` with the new cursor, pulling all updates, until `has_more` is `false`.

        When retrieving paginated updates, track both the `next_cursor` from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which `has_more` was `true`; if a call to `/processor/transactions/sync` fails when retrieving a paginated update, which can occur as a result of the [`TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/transactions/#transactions_sync_mutation_during_pagination) error, the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.

        Whenever new or updated transaction data becomes available, `/processor/transactions/sync` will provide these updates. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the `/processor/transactions/refresh` endpoint.

        Note that for newly created processor tokens, data may not be immediately available to `/processor/transactions/sync`. Plaid begins preparing transactions data when the corresponding Item is created, but the process can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to complete, depending on the number of transactions available.

        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

        `/processor/transactions/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Transactions product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for a processor token. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled processor token. If changes to transactions are discovered after calling `/processor/transactions/refresh`, Plaid will fire a webhook: for `/transactions/sync` users, [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#sync_updates_available) will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both `/processor/transactions/sync` and `/processor/transactions/get`, [`TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactions_removed) will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and [`DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#default_update) will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`. Note that the `/transactions/refresh` endpoint is not supported for Capital One (`ins_128026`) non-depository accounts and will result in a `PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED` error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.

        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

        `/processor/transactions/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Transactions and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        The `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.

        This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        This endpoint can only be called on a processor token that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in `/link/token/create`; or after Link, by calling `/processor/transactions/get` or `/processor/transactions/sync`). Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using `/processor/transactions/sync` listen for the [`SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#SyncUpdatesAvailableWebhook-historical-update-complete) webhook and check that the `historical_update_complete` field in the payload is `true`. If using `/processor/transactions/get`, listen for the [`HISTORICAL_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#historical_update) webhook.

        After the initial call, you can call `/processor/transactions/recurring/get` endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the [`RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#recurring_transactions_update) webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

        To receive Transactions webhooks for a processor token, set its webhook URL via the [`/processor/token/webhook/update`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/processor-partners/#processortokenwebhookupdate) endpoint.

      description: |-
        Use `/processor/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction as a processor to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and risk tier) and additional risk signals.

        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If `/processor/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned. For more information please refer to our error documentation on [item errors](/docs/errors/item/) and [Link in Update Mode](/docs/link/update-mode/).

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if Signal is being added to an existing Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution when retrieving the data for the first time. To reduce this latency, you can call `/signal/prepare` on the Item before you need to request Signal data.

      description: |-
        When a processor token is not initialized with Signal, call `/processor/signal/prepare` to opt-in that processor token to the Signal data collection process, which will improve the accuracy of the Signal score.

        If this endpoint is called with a processor token that is already initialized with Signal, it will return a 200 response and will not modify the processor token.

        The `/processor/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about a loan or credit account. Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`.

        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/processor/liabilities/get`.

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if `liabilities` was not specified as an initial product when creating the processor token. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution to retrieve the additional data.

        The `/processor/identity/match` endpoint generates a match score, which indicates how well the provided identity data matches the identity information on file with the account holder's financial institution.

        Fields within the `balances` object will always be null when retrieved by `/identity/match`. Instead, use the free `/accounts/get` endpoint to request balance cached data, or `/accounts/balance/get` for real-time data.

          The `/processor/balance/get` endpoint returns the real-time balance for the account associated with a given `processor_token`.

          The current balance is the total amount of funds in the account. The available balance is the current balance less any outstanding holds or debits that have not yet posted to the account.

          Note that not all institutions calculate the available balance. In the event that available balance is unavailable from the institution, Plaid will return an available balance value of `null`.

        By default, the `access_token` associated with an Item does not expire and should be stored in a persistent, secure manner.

        You can use the `/item/access_token/invalidate` endpoint to rotate the `access_token` associated with an Item. The endpoint returns a new `access_token` and immediately invalidates the previous `access_token`.

        The `/liabilities/get` endpoint returns various details about an Item with loan or credit accounts. Liabilities data is available primarily for US financial institutions, with some limited coverage of Canadian institutions. Currently supported account types are account type `credit` with account subtype `credit card` or `paypal`, and account type `loan` with account subtype `student` or `mortgage`. To limit accounts listed in Link to types and subtypes supported by Liabilities, you can use the `account_filters` parameter when [creating a Link token](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#linktokencreate).

        The types of information returned by Liabilities can include balances and due dates, loan terms, and account details such as original loan amount and guarantor. Data is refreshed approximately once per day; the latest data can be retrieved by calling `/liabilities/get`.

        Create a payment recipient for payment initiation.  The recipient must be in Europe, within a country that is a member of the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) or a non-Eurozone country [supported](https://plaid.com/global) by Plaid. For a standing order (recurring) payment, the recipient must be in the UK.

        It is recommended to use `bacs` in the UK and `iban` in EU.

        The endpoint is idempotent: if a developer has already made a request with the same payment details, Plaid will return the same `recipient_id`.

        After creating a payment recipient, you can use the `/payment_initiation/payment/create` endpoint to create a payment to that recipient.  Payments can be one-time or standing order (recurring) and can be denominated in either EUR, GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency).  If making domestic GBP-denominated payments, your recipient must have been created with BACS numbers. In general, EUR-denominated payments will be sent via SEPA Credit Transfer, GBP-denominated payments will be sent via the Faster Payments network and for non-Eurozone markets typically via the local payment scheme, but the payment network used will be determined by the institution. Payments sent via Faster Payments will typically arrive immediately, while payments sent via SEPA Credit Transfer or other local payment schemes will typically arrive in one business day.

        Standing orders (recurring payments) must be denominated in GBP and can only be sent to recipients in the UK. Once created, standing order payments cannot be modified or canceled via the API. An end user can cancel or modify a standing order directly on their banking application or website, or by contacting the bank. Standing orders will follow the payment rules of the underlying rails (Faster Payments in UK). Payments can be sent Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays. If the pre-arranged date falls on a weekend or bank holiday, the payment is made on the next working day. It is not possible to guarantee the exact time the payment will reach the recipient’s account, although at least 90% of standing order payments are sent by 6am.

        In Limited Production, payments must be below 5 GBP or other chosen [currency](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/payment-initiation/#payment_initiation-payment-create-request-amount-currency), and standing orders, variable recurring payments, and Virtual Accounts are not supported.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` endpoint has been deprecated. New Plaid customers will be unable to use this endpoint, and existing customers are encouraged to migrate to the newer, `link_token`-based flow. The recommended flow is to provide the `payment_id` to `/link/token/create`, which returns a `link_token` used to initialize Link.

        The `/payment_initiation/payment/token/create` is used to create a `payment_token`, which can then be used in Link initialization to enter a payment initiation flow. You can only use a `payment_token` once. If this attempt fails, the end user aborts the flow, or the token expires, you will need to create a new payment token. Creating a new payment token does not require end user input.

        `/sandbox/item/reset_login/` forces an Item into an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` state in order to simulate an Item whose login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test Link's [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) flow in the Sandbox environment.  After calling `/sandbox/item/reset_login`, You can then use Plaid Link update mode to restore the Item to a good state. An `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` webhook will also be fired after a call to this endpoint, if one is associated with the Item.


        In the Sandbox, Items will transition to an `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` error state automatically after 30 days, even if this endpoint is not called.

        Exchange a Link `public_token` for an API `access_token`. Link hands off the `public_token` client-side via the `onSuccess` callback once a user has successfully created an Item. The `public_token` is ephemeral and expires after 30 minutes. An `access_token` does not expire, but can be revoked by calling `/item/remove`.

        The response also includes an `item_id` that should be stored with the `access_token`. The `item_id` is used to identify an Item in a webhook. The `item_id` can also be retrieved by making an `/item/get` request.

        Note: As of July 2020, the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is deprecated. Instead, use `/link/token/create` with an `access_token` to create a Link token for use with [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode).

        If you need your user to take action to restore or resolve an error associated with an Item, generate a public token with the `/item/public_token/create` endpoint and then initialize Link with that `public_token`.

        A `public_token` is one-time use and expires after 30 minutes. You use a `public_token` to initialize Link in [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) for a particular Item. You can generate a `public_token` for an Item even if you did not use Link to create the Item originally.

        The `/item/public_token/create` endpoint is **not** used to create your initial `public_token`. If you have not already received an `access_token` for a specific Item, use Link to obtain your `public_token` instead. See the [Quickstart](https://plaid.com/docs/quickstart) for more information.

        This endpoint should be called for each of your end users before they begin a Plaid Check or Income flow, or a Multi-Item Link flow. This provides you a single token to access all data associated with the user. You should only create one per end user.

        The `consumer_report_user_identity` object must be present in order to create a Plaid Check Consumer Report for a user. If it is not provided during the `/user/create` call, it can be added later by calling `/user/update`.

        If you call the endpoint multiple times with the same `client_user_id`, the first creation call will succeed and the rest will fail with an error message indicating that the user has been created for the given `client_user_id`.

        Ensure that you store the `user_token` along with your user's identifier in your database, as it is not possible to retrieve a previously created `user_token`.

      description: |-
        The `/investments/transactions/get` endpoint allows developers to retrieve up to 24 months of user-authorized transaction data for investment accounts.

        Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift.

        Due to the potentially large number of investment transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the `total_investment_transactions` response body field to fetch all available investment transactions.

        Note that Investments does not have a webhook to indicate when initial transaction data has loaded (unless you use the `async_update` option). Instead, if transactions data is not ready when `/investments/transactions/get` is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling `/investments/transactions/get` immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.

        Data returned by the asynchronous investments extraction flow (when `async_update` is set to true) may not be immediately available to `/investments/transactions/get`. To be alerted when the data is ready to be fetched, listen for the `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhook. If no investments history is ready when `/investments/transactions/get` is called, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_READY` error.

      description: |-
        `/investments/refresh` is an optional endpoint for users of the Investments product. It initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest investment holdings and transactions for an Item. This on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Investments-enabled Item. If changes to investments are discovered after calling `/investments/refresh`, Plaid will fire webhooks: [`HOLDINGS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#holdings-default_update) if any new holdings are detected, and [`INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS: DEFAULT_UPDATE`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/investments/#investments_transactions-default_update) if any new investment transactions are detected. Updated holdings and investment transactions can be fetched by calling `/investments/holdings/get` and `/investments/transactions/get`. Note that the `/investments/refresh` endpoint is not supported by all institutions. If called on an Item from an institution that does not support this functionality, it will return a `PRODUCT_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.

        As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.

        `/investments/refresh` is offered as an add-on to Investments and has a separate [fee model](/docs/account/billing/#per-request-flat-fee). To request access to this endpoint, submit a [product access request](https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/products) or contact your Plaid account manager.

        Used to create a token suitable for sending to Stripe to enable Plaid-Stripe integrations. For a detailed guide on integrating Stripe, see [Add Stripe to your app](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/partnerships/stripe/).

        Note that the Stripe bank account token is a one-time use token. To store bank account information for later use, you can use a Stripe customer object and create an associated bank account from the token, or you can use a Stripe Custom account and create an associated external bank account from the token. This bank account information should work indefinitely, unless the user's bank account information changes or they revoke Plaid's permissions to access their account. Stripe bank account information cannot be modified once the bank account token has been created. If you ever need to change the bank account details used by Stripe for a specific customer, have the user go through Link again and create a new bank account token from the new `access_token`.

        To revoke a bank account token, the entire underlying access token must be revoked using `/item/remove`.

As part of an `/item/import` request, you will include a User ID (`user_auth.user_id`) and Authentication Token (`user_auth.auth_token`) that enable data aggregation through your Plaid Exchange API endpoints. These authentication principals are to be chosen by you.

        Upon creating an Item via `/item/import`, Plaid will automatically begin an extraction of that Item through the Plaid Exchange infrastructure you have already integrated.

        The `/link/token/create` endpoint creates a `link_token`, which is required as a parameter when initializing Link. Once Link has been initialized, it returns a `public_token`. For most Plaid products, the `public_token` is saved and exchanged for an `access_token` via `/item/public_token/exchange` as part of the main Link flow. For more details, see the [Link flow overview](https://plaid.com/docs/link/#link-flow-overview).

        A `link_token` generated by `/link/token/create` is also used to initialize other Link flows, such as the [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode) flow for tokens with expired credentials, or the Identity Verification flow.

      description: The `/link/token/get` endpoint gets information about a Link session, including all callbacks fired during the session along with their metadata, including the public token. This endpoint is used with Link flows that don't provide a public token via frontend callbacks, such as the [Hosted Link flow](https://plaid.com/docs/link/hosted-link/) and the [Multi-Item Link flow](https://plaid.com/docs/link/multi-item-link/). It also can be useful for debugging purposes.

        Exchange an OAuth `link_correlation_id` for the corresponding `link_token`. The `link_correlation_id` is only available for 'payment_initiation' products and is provided to the client via the OAuth `redirect_uri` as a query parameter.
        The `link_correlation_id` is ephemeral and expires in a brief period, after which it can no longer be exchanged for the 'link_token'.

      description: "Use the `/transfer/authorization/create` endpoint to authorize a transfer. This endpoint must be called prior to calling `/transfer/create`. The transfer authorization will expire if not used after one hour. (You can contact your account manager to change the default authorization lifetime.) \n\nThere are four possible outcomes to calling this endpoint: \n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` in the response is `declined`, the proposed transfer has failed the risk check and you cannot proceed with the transfer. \n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` is `user_action_required`, additional user input is needed, usually to fix a broken bank connection, before Plaid can properly assess the risk. You need to launch Link in update mode to complete the required user action. When calling `/link/token/create` to get a new Link token, instead of providing `access_token` in the request, you should set [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) as the `authorization.id`. After the Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization.\n\n  - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved`, and the `authorization.rationale_code` is `null`, the transfer has passed the risk check and you can proceed to call `/transfer/create`.\n  \n  - If the `authorization.decision` is `approved` and the `authorization.rationale_code` is non-`null`, the risk check could not be run: you may proceed with the transfer, but should perform your own risk evaluation. For more details, see the response schema.\n\nIn Plaid's Sandbox environment the decisions will be returned as follows:\n\n  - To approve a transfer with `null` rationale code, make an authorization request with an `amount` less than the available balance in the account.\n\n  - To approve a transfer with the rationale code `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM`, create an Item in Link through the [Same Day Micro-deposits flow](https://plaid.com/docs/auth/coverage/testing/#testing-same-day-micro-deposits).\n\n  - To get an authorization decision of `user_action_required`, [reset the login for an Item](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/#item_login_required).\n\n  - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `NSF`, the available balance on the account must be less than the authorization `amount`. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox.\n\n  - To decline a transfer with the rationale code `RISK`, the available balance on the account must be exactly $0. See [Create Sandbox test data](https://plaid.com/docs/sandbox/user-custom/) for details on how to customize data in Sandbox."

This endpoint works on all Transfer-capable Items, including those created by `/transfer/migrate_account`. To simulate RTP eligibility in Sandbox, log in using the username `user_good` and password `pass_good` and use the first two checking and savings accounts in the "First Platypus Bank" institution (ending in 0000 or 1111), which will return `true`. Any other account will return `false`.

        Use the `/bank_transfer/balance/get` endpoint to see the available balance in your bank transfer account. Debit transfers increase this balance once their status is posted. Credit transfers decrease this balance when they are created.

        The transactable balance shows the amount in your account that you are able to use for transfers, and is essentially your available balance minus your minimum balance.

        Note that this endpoint can only be used with FBO accounts, when using Bank Transfers in the Full Service configuration. It cannot be used on your own account when using Bank Transfers in the BTS Platform configuration.

        Use the `/transfer/refund/create` endpoint to create a refund for a transfer. A transfer can be refunded if the transfer was initiated in the past 180 days.

        Processing of the refund will not occur until at least 4 business days following the transfer's settlement date, plus any hold/settlement delays. This 3-day window helps better protect your business from regular ACH returns. Consumer initiated returns (unauthorized returns) could still happen for about 60 days from the settlement date. If the original transfer is canceled, returned or failed, all pending refunds will automatically be canceled. Processed refunds cannot be revoked.

        Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/create` endpoint to create a `test_clock` in the Sandbox environment.

        A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. Test clocks are used for testing recurring transfers in Sandbox.

        A test clock can be associated with up to 5 recurring transfers.

        Use the `/sandbox/transfer/test_clock/advance` endpoint to advance a `test_clock` in the Sandbox environment.

        A test clock object represents an independent timeline and has a `virtual_time` field indicating the current timestamp of the timeline. A test clock can be advanced by incrementing `virtual_time`, but may never go back to a lower `virtual_time`.

        If a test clock is advanced, we will simulate the changes that ought to occur during the time that elapsed.

        For example, a client creates a weekly recurring transfer with a test clock set at t. When the client advances the test clock by setting `virtual_time` = t + 15 days, 2 new originations should be created, along with the webhook events.

        The advancement of the test clock from its current `virtual_time` should be limited such that there are no more than 20 originations resulting from the advance operation on each `recurring_transfer` associated with the `test_clock`.

        For example, if the recurring transfer associated with this test clock originates once every 4 weeks, you can advance the `virtual_time` up to 80 weeks on each API call.

        `/sandbox/payment_profile/reset_login/` forces a Payment Profile into a state where the login is no longer valid. This makes it easy to test update mode for Payment Profile in the Sandbox environment.

         After calling `/sandbox/payment_profile/reset_login`, calls to the `/transfer/authorization/create` with the Payment Profile will result in a `decision_rationale` `PAYMENT_PROFILE_LOGIN_REQUIRED`. You can then use update mode for Payment Profile to restore it into a good state.

         In order to invoke this endpoint, you must first [create a Payment Profile](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer/add-to-app/#create-a-payment-profile-optional) and [go through the Link flow](https://plaid.com/docs/transfer/add-to-app/#create-a-link-token).

        `/employers/search` allows you the ability to search Plaid’s database of known employers, for use with Deposit Switch. You can use this endpoint to look up a user's employer in order to confirm that they are supported. Users with non-supported employers can then be routed out of the Deposit Switch flow.

        The data in the employer database is currently limited. As the Deposit Switch and Income products progress through their respective beta periods, more employers are being regularly added. Because the employer database is frequently updated, we recommend that you do not cache or store data from this endpoint for more than a day.

        `/income/verification/paystubs/get` returns the information collected from the paystubs that were used to verify an end user's income. It can be called once the status of the verification has been set to `VERIFICATION_STATUS_PROCESSING_COMPLETE`, as reported by the `INCOME: verification_status` webhook. Attempting to call the endpoint before verification has been completed will result in an error.

        This endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use `/credit/payroll_income/get` instead.

        `/income/verification/documents/download` provides the ability to download the source documents associated with the verification.

        If Document Income was used, the documents will be those the user provided in Link. For Payroll Income, the most recent files available
        for download from the payroll provider will be available from this endpoint.

        The response to `/income/verification/documents/download` is a ZIP file in binary data. If a `document_id` is passed, a single document will be contained in this file.
        If not, the response will contain all documents associated with the verification.

        The `request_id` is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

        `/income/verification/taxforms/get` returns the information collected from forms that were used to verify an end user''s income. It can be called once the status of the verification has been set to `VERIFICATION_STATUS_PROCESSING_COMPLETE`, as reported by the `INCOME: verification_status` webhook. Attempting to call the endpoint before verification has been completed will result in an error.

        This endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use `/credit/payroll_income/get` instead.

        `/income/verification/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification and returns a `precheck_id` that can be provided to `/link/token/create`. If the user is eligible for digital verification, providing the `precheck_id` in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the `precheck_id` can still be provided to `/link/token/create` and the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

        While all request fields are optional, providing either `employer` or `transactions_access_tokens` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

        This endpoint has been deprecated; new integrations should use `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` instead.

        Plaid can create an Audit Copy token of an Asset Report and/or Income Report to share with participating Government Sponsored Entity (GSE). If you participate in the Day 1 Certainty™ program, Plaid can supply an Audit Copy token directly to Fannie Mae on your behalf. An Audit Copy token contains the same underlying data as the Asset Report and/or Income Report (result of /credit/payroll_income/get).

        Use the `/credit/audit_copy_token/create` endpoint to create an `audit_copy_token` and then pass that token to the GSE who needs access.

        `/credit/payroll_income/risk_signals/get` can be used as part of the Document Income flow to assess a user-uploaded document for signs of potential fraud or tampering. It returns a risk score for each uploaded document that indicates the likelihood of the document being fraudulent, in addition to details on the individual risk signals contributing to the score.

        To trigger risk signal generation for an Item, call `/link/token/create` with `parsing_config` set to include `risk_signals`, or call `/credit/payroll_income/parsing_config/update`. Once risk signal generation has been triggered, `/credit/payroll_income/risk_signals/get` can be called at any time after the `INCOME_VERIFICATION_RISK_SIGNALS` webhook has been fired.

        `/credit/payroll_income/risk_signals/get` is offered as an add-on to Document Income and is billed separately. To request access to this endpoint, submit a product access request or contact your Plaid account manager.

      description: |-
        `/credit/payroll_income/precheck` is an optional endpoint that can be called before initializing a Link session for income verification. It evaluates whether a given user is supportable by digital income verification. If the user is eligible for digital verification, that information will be associated with the user token, and in this way will generate a Link UI optimized for the end user and their specific employer. If the user cannot be confirmed as eligible, the user can still use the income verification flow, but they may be required to manually upload a paystub to verify their income.

        While all request fields are optional, providing `employer` data will increase the chance of receiving a useful result.

        When testing in Sandbox, you can control the results by providing special test values in the `employer` and `access_tokens` fields. `employer_good` and `employer_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively. `employer_multi` will result in a `HIGH` confidence with multiple payroll options. Likewise, `access_good` and `access_bad` will result in `HIGH` and `LOW` confidence values, respectively. Any other value for `employer` and `access_tokens` in Sandbox will result in `UNKNOWN` confidence.

        Plaid can share an Asset Report directly with a participating third party on your behalf. The shared Asset Report is the exact same Asset Report originally created in `/asset_report/create`.

        To grant a third party access to an Asset Report, use the `/credit/relay/create` endpoint to create a `relay_token` and then pass that token to your third party. Each third party has its own `secondary_client_id`; for example, `ce5bd328dcd34123456`. You'll need to create a separate `relay_token` for each third party that needs access to the report on your behalf.

        `/credit/relay/pdf/get` allows third parties to receive a pdf report that was shared with them, using a `relay_token` that was created by the report owner.

        The `/credit/relay/pdf/get` endpoint retrieves the Asset Report in PDF format. Before calling `/credit/relay/pdf/get`, you must first create the Asset Report using `/credit/relay/create` and then wait for the [`PRODUCT_READY`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#product_ready) webhook to fire, indicating that the Report is ready to be retrieved.

        The response to `/credit/relay/pdf/get` is the PDF binary data. The `request_id` is returned in the `Plaid-Request-ID` header.

      operationId: signalEvaluate
      description: |-
        Use `/signal/evaluate` to evaluate a planned ACH transaction to get a return risk assessment (such as a risk score and risk tier) and additional risk signals.

        In order to obtain a valid score for an ACH transaction, Plaid must have an access token for the account, and the Item must be healthy (receiving product updates) or have recently been in a healthy state. If the transaction does not meet eligibility requirements, an error will be returned corresponding to the underlying cause. If `/signal/evaluate` is called on the same transaction multiple times within a 24-hour period, cached results may be returned. For more information please refer to the error documentation on [Item errors](/docs/errors/item/) and [Link in Update Mode](/docs/link/update-mode/).

        Note: This request may take some time to complete if Signal is being added to an existing Item. This is because Plaid must communicate directly with the institution when retrieving the data for the first time.

      summary: Opt-in an Item to Signal
      externalDocs:
        url: /api/products/signal#signalprepare
      operationId: signalPrepare
      description: |-
        When an Item is not initialized with Signal, call `/signal/prepare` to opt-in that Item to the Signal data collection process, developing a Signal score. This should be done on Items where Signal was added in the `additional_consented_products` array but not in the `products`, `optional_products`, or `required_if_supported_products` array. If `/signal/prepare` is skipped on an Item that is not initialized with Signal, the initial call to `/signal/evaluate` on that Item will be less accurate, because Signal will have access to less data for computing the Signal score.

        If run on an Item that is already initialized with Signal, this endpoint will return a 200 response and will not modify the Item.

In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. If a value under 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of history will be requested.\n\nIf you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/get` request.\n\nIf the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via `/item/remove` and send the user through Link to create a new Item. \n\nCustomers using [Recurring Transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results."

In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default.\n\nIf you are initializing your Items with transactions during the `/link/token/create` call (e.g. by including `transactions` in the `/link/token/create` `products` array), you must use the [`transactions.days_requested`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transactions-days-requested) field in the `/link/token/create` request instead of in the `/transactions/sync` request.\n\nIf the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via `/item/remove` and send the user through Link to create a new Item. \n\nCustomers using [Recurring Transactions](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsrecurringget) should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results."

            Some institutions may limit the reference to less than 18 characters. If necessary, Plaid will adjust the reference by truncating it to fit the institution's requirements.
            Both the originally provided and automatically adjusted references (if any) can be found in the `reference` and `adjusted_reference` fields, respectively.

        The status of the payment.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED`: This is the initial state of all payments. It indicates that the payment is waiting on user input to continue processing. A payment may re-enter this state later on if further input is needed.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`: The payment has been successfully authorised and accepted by the financial institution. For successful payments, this is a potential terminal status. Further status transitions can be to REJECTED and, when supported by the institution, to EXECUTED.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`: The payment has failed due to insufficient funds.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED`: The payment has failed to be initiated. This error may be caused by transient system outages and is retryable once the root cause is resolved.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED`: The payment has been blocked by Plaid. This can occur, for example, due to Plaid flagging the payment as potentially risky. This is a retryable error.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING`: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when the financial institution has authorised the transaction.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED`: The payment was cancelled (typically by the end user) during authorisation.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED`: The funds have successfully left the payer account and payment is considered complete. Not all institutions support this status: support is more common in the UK, and less common in the EU. For institutions where this status is not supported, the terminal status for a successful payment will be `PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED`.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED`: The payment has settled and funds are available for use. A payment will typically settle within seconds to several days, depending on which payment rail is used. This status is only available to customers using [Plaid Virtual Accounts](https://plaid.com/docs/virtual-accounts/).

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED`: The payment was rejected by the financial institution.

        Deprecated:
        These statuses will be removed in a future release.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN`: The payment status is unknown.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING`: The payment is currently being processed. The payment will automatically exit this state when processing is complete.

        `PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED`: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established. This state is only used for standing orders.

            If using Identity Verification, `country_codes` should be set to the country where your company is based, not the country where your user is located. For all other products, `country_codes` represents the location of your user's financial institution.

            If Link is launched with multiple country codes, only products that you are enabled for in all countries will be used by Link. Note that while all countries are enabled by default in Sandbox, in Production only US and Canada are enabled by default. To request access to European institutions, [file a product access Support ticket](https://dashboard.plaid.com/support/new/product-and-development/product-troubleshooting/request-product-access) via the Plaid dashboard.

            If using a Link customization, make sure the country codes in the customization match those specified in `country_codes`, or the customization may not be applied.

            If using the Auth features Instant Match, Instant Micro-deposits, Same-day Micro-deposits, Automated Micro-deposits, or Database Insights, `country_codes` must be set to `['US']`.

Only institutions that support *all* requested products can be selected; a if a user attempts to select an institution that does not support a listed product, a \"Connectivity not supported\" error message will appear in Link. To maximize the number of institutions available, initialize Link with the minimal product set required for your use case. \n\nAdditional products can be included via the [`optional_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-optional-products) or  [`required_if_supported_products`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-required-if-supported-products) fields.

For details, see [Choosing when to initialize products](https://plaid.com/docs/link/initializing-products/).\n\nNote that, unless you have opted to disable Instant Match support, institutions that support Instant Match will also be shown in Link if `auth` is specified as a product, even though these institutions do not contain `auth` in their product array.\n\nIn Production, you will be billed for each product that you specify when initializing Link. Note that a product cannot be removed from an Item once the Item has been initialized with that product. To stop billing on an Item for subscription-based products, such as Liabilities, Investments, and Transactions, remove the Item via `/item/remove`."

    LinkTokenAccountFilters:
      description: |
        By default, Link will provide limited account filtering: it will only display Institutions that are compatible with all products supplied in the `products` parameter of `/link/token/create`, and, if `auth` is specified in the `products` array, will also filter out accounts other than `checking` and `savings` accounts on the Account Select pane. You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link. For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).

        The filter may or may not impact the list of accounts shown by the institution in the OAuth account selection flow, depending on the specific institution. If the user selects excluded account subtypes in the OAuth flow, these accounts will not be added to the Item. If the user selects only excluded account subtypes, the link attempt will fail and the user will be prompted to try again.

    LinkTokenCreateRequestAccountSubtypes:
      description: |
        By default, Link will only display account types that are compatible with all products supplied in the `products` parameter of `/link/token/create`. You can further limit the accounts shown in Link by using `account_filters` to specify the account subtypes to be shown in Link. Only the specified subtypes will be shown. This filtering applies to both the Account Select view (if enabled) and the Institution Select view. Institutions that do not support the selected subtypes will be omitted from Link. To indicate that all subtypes should be shown, use the value `"all"`. If the `account_filters` filter is used, any account type for which a filter is not specified will be entirely omitted from Link.

        For a full list of valid types and subtypes, see the [Account schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts#account-type-schema).

        For institutions using OAuth, the filter will not affect the list of institutions or accounts shown by the bank in the OAuth window.

            If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.

This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field may be populated for any account; in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

      properties:
        available:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: |-
            The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

            For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

            For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

            Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

            Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            If `current` is `null` this field is guaranteed not to be `null`.

          type: number
          format: double
          description: |-
            The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

            For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

            For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

            Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

            For `depository`-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.

            This field is only used and expected when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One) and the Item contains one or more accounts with a non-depository account type, in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned. For Capital One depository accounts as well as all other account types on all other institutions, this field is ignored. See [account type schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type-schema) for a full list of account types.

            If the balance that is pulled is older than the given timestamp for Items with this field required, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response.

        The status of an institution is determined by the health of its Item logins, Transactions updates, Investments updates, Liabilities updates, Auth requests, Balance requests, Identity requests, Investments requests, and Liabilities requests. A login attempt is conducted during the initial Item add in Link. If there is not enough traffic to accurately calculate an institution's status, Plaid will return null rather than potentially inaccurate data.

        Institution status is accessible in the Dashboard and via the API using the `/institutions/get_by_id` endpoint with the `include_status` option set to true. Note that institution status is not available in the Sandbox environment.

        Fired when an Item's transactions change. This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the `SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` webhook when using the `/transactions/sync` endpoint. Note that when using `/transactions/sync` the older webhooks `INITIAL_UPDATE`, `HISTORICAL_UPDATE`, `DEFAULT_UPDATE`, and `TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED`, which are intended for use with `/transactions/get`, will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using `/transactions/sync`.

        After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from `/transactions/sync`.

        Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, `/transactions/sync` must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the `INITIAL_UPDATE` and `HISTORICAL_UPDATE` webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If `/transactions/sync` is called on an Item that was *not* initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.

        This webhook will fire in the Sandbox environment as it would in Production. It can also be manually triggered in Sandbox by calling `/sandbox/item/fire_webhook`.

If the end user revoked their permissions through Plaid (such as via the Plaid Portal or by contacting Plaid Support), the webhook will fire. If the end user revoked their permissions directly through the institution, this webhook may not always fire, since some institutions’ consent portals do not trigger this webhook. Upon receiving this webhook, it is recommended to delete any stored data from Plaid associated with the Item. To restore the Item, it can be sent through [update mode](https://plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode). \n\nNote that when working with tokenized account numbers with Auth or Transfer, the account number provided by Plaid will no longer work for creating transfers once user permission has been revoked."

        Any non-`null` value for an `approved` transfer indicates that the the authorization check could not be run and that you should perform your own risk assessment on the transfer. The code will indicate why the check could not be run. Possible values for an `approved` transfer are:

        `MANUALLY_VERIFIED_ITEM` – Item created via a manual entry flow (i.e. Same Day Micro-deposit, Instant Micro-deposit, Database Insights, or Database Match), limited information available.

        `ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED` – Unable to collect the account information due to Item staleness. Can be resolved by using Link and setting [`transfer.authorization_id`](https://plaid.com/docs/api/link/#link-token-create-request-transfer-authorization-id) in the request to `/link/token/create`.

        `MIGRATED_ACCOUNT_ITEM` - Item created via `/transfer/migrate_account` endpoint, limited information available.

        `ERROR` – Unable to collect the account information due to an unspecified error.

        The following codes indicate that the authorization decision was `declined`:

        `NSF` – Transaction likely to result in a return due to insufficient funds.

        `RISK` - Transaction is high-risk.

        `TRANSFER_LIMIT_REACHED` - One or several transfer limits are reached, e.g. monthly transfer limit. Check the accompanying `description` field to understand which limit has been reached.

        For transfers submitted using `same-day-ach`, the same-day cutoff is 3:30 PM Eastern Time. If the transfer is submitted after this cutoff but before the next-day cutoff, it will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges.

        For transfers submitted using `rtp`, in the case that the account being credited does not support RTP, the transfer will be sent over ACH as long as an `ach_class` is provided in the request. If RTP isn't supported by the account and no `ach_class` is provided, the transfer will fail to be submitted.

        For transfers submitted as `same-day-ach`, the same-day cutoff is 3:30 PM Eastern Time. If the transfer is submitted after this cutoff but before the next-day cutoff, it will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges; this will apply to both legs of the transfer if applicable.

        For transfers submitted as `rtp`,  Plaid will automatically route between Real Time Payment rail by TCH or FedNow rails as necessary. If a transfer is submitted as `rtp` and the counterparty account is not eligible for RTP, the `/transfer/authorization/create` request will fail with an `INVALID_FIELD` error code. To pre-check to determine whether a counterparty account can support RTP, call `/transfer/capabilities/get` before calling `/transfer/authorization/create`.

        Wire transfers are currently in early availability. To request access to `wire` as a payment network, contact your Account Manager. For transfers submitted as `wire`, the `type` must be `credit`; wire debits are not supported.

It is recommended to submit a request at least 15 minutes before the cutoff time in order to ensure that it will be processed before the cutoff. Any request that is indicated as `same-day-ach` and that misses the same-day cutoff, but is submitted in time for the next-day cutoff, will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges.

        A decision regarding the proposed transfer.

        `approved` – The proposed transfer has received the end user's consent and has been approved for processing by Plaid. The `decision_rationale` field is set if Plaid was unable to fetch the account information. You may proceed with the transfer, but further review is recommended. Refer to the `code` field in the `decision_rationale` object for details.

        `declined` – Plaid reviewed the proposed transfer and declined processing. Refer to the `code` field in the `decision_rationale` object for details.

        `user_action_required` – An action is required before Plaid can assess the transfer risk and make a decision. The most common scenario is to update authentication for an Item. To complete the required action, initialize Link by setting `transfer.authorization_id` in the request of `/link/token/create`. After Link flow is completed, you may re-attempt the authorization request.

        Describes a sweep of funds to / from the sweep account.

        A sweep is associated with many sweep events (events of type `swept` or `return_swept`) which can be retrieved by invoking the `/transfer/event/list` endpoint with the corresponding `sweep_id`.

        `swept` events occur when the transfer amount is credited or debited from your sweep account, depending on the `type` of the transfer. `return_swept` events occur when a transfer is returned and Plaid undoes the credit or debit.

        The total sum of the `swept` and `return_swept` events is equal to the `amount` of the sweep Plaid creates and matches the amount of the entry on your sweep account ledger.

We suggest starting with a threshold of 80 for auto-rejection and 20 for auto-acceptance. As you gather more data points on typical risk scores for your use case, you can tune these parameters to reduce the number of documents undergoing manual review.

            A score from 1-99 that indicates the transaction return risk: a higher risk score suggests a higher return likelihood.

If a request to execute a wallet transaction fails due to a network connection error, then after a minimum delay of one minute, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that only a single wallet transaction is created. If the request was successfully processed, it will prevent any transaction that uses the same idempotency key, and was received within 24 hours of the first request, from being processed.

        `DENIED`: The end customer has been created and enabled in Sandbox and Limited Production, but it did not pass review by the Plaid team and therefore cannot be enabled for full Production access. Talk to your Account Manager for more information.

      description: |-
        The `USER_ACCOUNT_REVOKED` webhook is fired when an end user has revoked access to their account on the Data Provider's portal. This webhook is currently sent only for Chase Items, but may be sent in the future for other financial institutions that allow account-level permissions revocation through their portals. Upon receiving this webhook, it is recommended to delete any Plaid-derived data you have stored that is associated with the revoked account.

        If you are using Auth and receive this webhook, this webhook indicates that the TAN associated with the revoked account is no longer valid and cannot be used to create new transfers. You should not create new ACH transfers for the account that was revoked until access has been re-granted.

        You can request the user to re-grant access to their account by sending them through [update mode](https://www.plaid.com/docs/link/update-mode). Alternatively, they may re-grant access directly through the Data Provider's portal.

        After the user has re-granted access, Auth customers should call the auth endpoint again to obtain the new TAN.

        This webhook contains a summary of the events from a Link session and will be fired after the user finishes going through Link. If the user abandons the Link flow (i.e., closes the hosted link webpage or leaves Link open for too long without taking any action), the webhook will be fired 5-15 minutes after the last user interaction. A single Link session may occasionally generate multiple `EVENTS` webhooks. If this occurs, the new webhook will contain all previous events for the session, as well as new events that occurred since the previous `EVENTS` webhook was sent. If this occurs, events can be grouped using the `link_session_id` field and, if necessary, de-duplicated using the `event_id` field.

        By default, the `EVENTS` webhook is sent only for sessions where the end user goes through a Hosted Link flow (including Link Recovery flows). If you would like to receive this webhook for sessions not using Hosted Link, contact your Account Manager or Support.

        A list of add-ons that should be included in the Asset Report.

        `fast_assets`: When Fast Assets is requested, Plaid will create two versions of the Asset Report: the Fast Asset Report, which will contain only Identity and Balance information, and the Full Asset Report, which will also contain Transactions information. A `PRODUCT_READY` webhook will be fired for each Asset Report when it is ready, and the `report_type` field will indicate whether the webhook is firing for the `full` or `fast` Asset Report. To retrieve the Fast Asset Report, call `/asset_report/get` with `fast_report` set to `true`. There is no additional charge for using Fast Assets. To create a Fast Asset Report, Plaid must successfully retrieve both Identity and Balance data; if Plaid encounters an error obtaining this data, the Fast Asset Report will not be created. However, as long as Plaid can obtain Transactions data, the Full Asset Report will still be available.

        `investments`: Request an Asset Report with Investments. This add-on is in closed beta and not generally available.

            The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

            For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

            For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

            Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

            Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

            For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

            For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

            Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

For Capital One depository accounts as well as all other account types on all other institutions, this field is ignored. See [account type schema](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#account-type-schema) for a full list of account types.

            If the balance that is pulled is older than the given timestamp for Items with this field required, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME_OUT_OF_RANGE` will be returned with the most recent timestamp for the requested account contained in the response.

            The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.

            For `credit`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `limit` less the `current` balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.

            For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance typically equals the `current` balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For `depository`-type accounts, the `available` balance does not include the overdraft limit.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the `available` balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.

            Note that not all institutions calculate the `available`  balance. In the event that `available` balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an `available` balance value of `null`.

            Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.

            For `credit`-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.

            For `loan`-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (`ins_116944`). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest.

            For `investment`-type accounts (or `brokerage`-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.

            Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by `/accounts/balance/get`; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the `available` balance as provided by `/accounts/balance/get`.

            When returned by `/accounts/balance/get`, this field may be `null`. When this happens, `available` is guaranteed not to be `null`.

            This field is only used and expected when the institution is `ins_128026` (Capital One) and the Item contains one or more accounts with a non-depository account type, in which case a value must be provided or an `INVALID_REQUEST` error with the code of `INVALID_FIELD` will be returned.

        A Beacon Report describes the type of fraud committed by a user as well as the date the fraud was committed and the total amount of money lost due to the fraud incident.

        This information is used to block similar fraud attempts on your platform as well as alert other companies who screen a user with matching identity information.
        Other companies will not receive any new identity information, just what matched, plus information such as industry, type of fraud, and date of fraud.

        You can manage your fraud reports by adding, deleting, or editing reports as you get additional information on fraudulent users.

        High level summary of whether the document in the provided image matches the formatting rules and security checks for the associated jurisdiction.

        For example, most identity documents have formatting rules like the following:


        The image of the person's face must have a certain contrast in order to highlight skin tone


        The subject in the document's image must remove eye glasses and pose in a certain way


        The informational fields (name, date of birth, ID number, etc.) must be colored and aligned according to specific rules


        Security features like watermarks and background patterns must be present

        So a `match` status for this field indicates that the document in the provided image seems to conform to the various formatting and security rules associated with the detected document.

        User information collected outside of Link, most likely via your own onboarding process.

        Each of the following identity fields are optional:

        `phone_number`

        `date_of_birth`

        `name`

        `address`

        `id_number`

        Specifically, these fields are optional in that they can either be fully provided (satisfying every required field in their subschema) or omitted from the request entirely by not providing the key or value.
        Providing these fields via the API will result in Link skipping the data collection process for the associated user. All verification steps enabled in the associated Identity Verification Template will still be run. Verification steps will either be run immediately, or once the user completes the `accept_tos` step, depending on the value provided to the `gave_consent` field.
        If you are not using the shareable URL feature, you can optionally provide these fields via `/link/token/create` instead; both `/identity_verification/create` and `/link/token/create` are valid ways to provide this information. Note that if you provide a non-`null` user data object via `/identity_verification/create`, any user data fields entered via `/link/token/create` for the same `client_user_id` will be ignored when prefilling Link.

        Specifically, these fields are optional in that they can either be fully provided (satisfying every required field in their subschema) or omitted from the request entirely by not providing the key or value.
        Providing these fields via the API will result in Link skipping the data collection process for the associated user. All verification steps enabled in the associated Identity Verification Template will still be run. Verification steps will either be run immediately, or once the user completes the `accept_tos` step, depending on the value provided to the `gave_consent` field.

        `failed` - The user failed one or more steps in the session and was told to contact support.

        `expired` - The Identity Verification attempt was active for a long period of time without being completed and was automatically marked as expired. Note that sessions currently do not expire. Automatic expiration is expected to be enabled in the future.

        `canceled` - The Identity Verification attempt was canceled, either via the dashboard by a user, or via API. The user may have completed part of the session, but has neither failed or passed.

        `active` - This step is the user's current step. They are either in the process of completing this step, or they recently closed their Identity Verification attempt while in the middle of this step. Only one step will be marked as `active` at any given point.

        `success` - The Identity Verification attempt has completed this step.

        `failed` - The user failed this step. This can either call the user to fail the session as a whole, or cause them to fallback to another step depending on how the Identity Verification template is configured. A failed step does not imply a failed session.

        `waiting_for_prerequisite` - The user needs to complete another step first, before they progress to this step. This step may never run, depending on if the user fails an earlier step or if the step is only run as a fallback.

        `not_applicable` - This step will not be run for this session.

        `skipped` - The retry instructions that created this Identity Verification attempt specified that this step should be skipped.

        `expired` - This step had not yet been completed when the Identity Verification attempt as a whole expired.

        `canceled` - The Identity Verification attempt was canceled before the user completed this step.

        `pending_review` - The Identity Verification attempt template was configured to perform a screening that had one or more hits needing review.

        `manually_approved` - The step was manually overridden to pass by a team member in the dashboard.

        `manually_rejected` - The step was manually overridden to fail by a team member in the dashboard.

        `coarse` - See more potential matches. This sensitivity will see more broad phonetic matches across alphabets that make missing a potential hit very unlikely. This setting is noisier and will require more manual review.

        `balanced` - A good default for most companies. This sensitivity is balanced to show high quality hits with reduced noise.

        `strict` - Aggressive false positive reduction. This sensitivity will require names to be more similar than `coarse` and `balanced` settings, relying less on phonetics, while still accounting for character transpositions, missing tokens, and other common permutations.

        `exact` - Matches must be nearly exact. This sensitivity will only show hits with exact or nearly exact name matches with only basic correction such as extraneous symbols and capitalization. This setting is generally not recommended unless you have a very specific use case.

This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new `account_id` will be assigned to the account.

            If an account with a specific `account_id` disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.

            Like all Plaid identifiers, the `account_id` is case sensitive.
